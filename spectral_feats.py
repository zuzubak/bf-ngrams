    Dict-ifies the contents of a csv containing mean spectral features for
    various syllables of various birds, in the format used in Logan's dataset.
    The format goes like this, with one bird per row:
    bird1ID,syllable1,syl1_feat1,syl1_feat2...,syl1_featn,,syllable2,syl2_feat1,syl2_feat2...,syl2_featn...
    The output dict nests features within syllables within birds.
